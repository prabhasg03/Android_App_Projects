# TicTacToe

## Description
TicTacToe is a classic Android game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of one's own marks (either X or O). This app implements the Tic Tac Toe game logic and provides a user interface for players to interact with.

## Features
- **Gameplay:** Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.
- **Turn indicator:** Displays whose turn it is (either X or O).
- **Win detection:** Automatically detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.

## Usage
1. Launch the TicTacToe app on your Android device.
2. Tap on any empty space on the grid to place your mark (either X or O).
3. Take turns with your opponent to place marks until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
4. If one player wins or the game ends, a message will be displayed indicating the result.
5. To start a new match, click on the "Play Again" button.

## Note
